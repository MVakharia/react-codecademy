# React projects

### A repository for React projects I've completed as part of the Full-Stack Engineer course on Codecademy and in my spare time. 

## Study topics list:

- Separate hooks for separate effects. Separation of concerns: make sure that you use one useEffect() per useState(), and if a single useEffect is handling an object with multiple unrelated key-value pairs, split the useEffect into multiple useEffects.

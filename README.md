# React projects

### A repository for React projects I've completed as part of the Full-Stack Engineer course on Codecademy and in my spare time. 

## Study topics list:

### useState and useEffect:

- Separate hooks for separate effects. Separation of concerns: make sure that you use one useEffect() per useState(), and if a single useEffect is handling an object with multiple unrelated key-value pairs, split the useEffect into multiple useEffects.

- Write an effect that manages a timer.

- Write an effect that manipulates the DOM.
- Write an effect that fetches data from a server (and another for fetching from an API).
- Write a cleanup function into an effect.
- Look up what it means to mount and unmount a function component.
- Write an effect with an unpopulated dependency array as the second srgument, and observe the outcome.
- Do the same but with an populated dependency array.
